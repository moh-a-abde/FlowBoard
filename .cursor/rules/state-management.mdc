State Management 

-Vuex/Pinia Usage: Use a centralized store for managing application-wide state.

-Reactive Data: Ensure reactive data is used efficiently to minimize unnecessary re-renders.

-Global State Handling: Store user preferences, task states, and UI settings globally.

-Persistence: Save state data using localStorage or Vuex persistence plugins.
