Vue.js Component Guidelines

-Component-Based Structure: Each feature should be broken into reusable Vue components.

-State Management: Utilize Vue’s reactive state with ref, reactive, or Pinia if needed.

-Props & Emit: Components should communicate using props and custom events.

-Lifecycle Hooks: Optimize performance by utilizing lifecycle hooks (onMounted, onUpdated, onUnmounted).

-Routing: Use Vue Router for navigation between different sections.

-API Calls: Handle external data fetching using fetch or Axios within setup() or Vue’s Composition API.
