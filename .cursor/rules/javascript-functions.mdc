JavaScript Functionality

-Drag-and-Drop: Implement drag-and-drop using Vueâ€™s event listeners (@dragstart, @dragover, @drop).

-Debouncing & Throttling: Optimize frequent user interactions with setTimeout or requestAnimationFrame.

-Data Manipulation: Utilize JavaScript array methods (map, filter, reduce) for efficient task operations.

-Async Operations: Use async/await for handling API responses cleanly.
