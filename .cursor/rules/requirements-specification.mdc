Implementation Requirements Specification

This document provides a step-by-step specification for implementing the functionalities of the Vue-based Task Management App using Vue.js, JavaScript, and TailwindCSS.

1. Project Setup

-Initialize a Vue 3 project using Vite.

-Install dependencies: Vue Router, Pinia (for state management), Axios (for API calls), and TailwindCSS.

-Configure TailwindCSS by setting up tailwind.config.js.

-Create a project folder structure following best practices (components, views, store, assets, api).

2. User Authentication

-Implement user sign-up, login, and logout functionalities using Firebase Auth or JWT-based authentication.

-Store authentication tokens securely in local storage.

-Protect routes using Vue Router navigation guards (beforeEach).

-Display user profile information in a navbar.

3. Kanban Board UI

-Create a BoardView.vue component to display the Kanban board.

-Implement draggable task cards using Vue’s built-in drag-and-drop events (@dragstart, @dragover, @drop).

-Use TailwindCSS for styling columns and task cards.

-Support adding, editing, and deleting task cards within a column.

4. Task Management

-Implement a Vuex/Pinia store to manage task data.

-Define actions for creating, updating, deleting, and moving tasks.

-Use local storage or API persistence for tasks.

-Implement real-time synchronization using WebSockets or periodic API polling.

5. API Integration

-Create an api.js file to handle all backend interactions.

-Define endpoints for:

-User authentication (/login, /register)

-Task CRUD operations (/tasks)

-Board management (/boards)

-Implement error handling and response validation.

6. State Management

-Use Pinia for global state management.

-Define separate stores for user authentication, tasks, and board settings.

-Persist task and board states using local storage or IndexedDB.

7. Performance Optimization

-Implement lazy loading for components using Vue’s dynamic import (defineAsyncComponent).

-Optimize API calls by debouncing search queries.

-Minimize DOM updates by using v-if instead of v-show when applicable.

-Enable Vue’s production mode for optimized performance.

8. Accessibility & UX Enhancements

-Ensure WCAG-compliant color contrast and text readability.

-Implement keyboard navigation support for task management.

-Add animations for smooth UI interactions using Tailwind’s animation utilities.

-Use tooltips and modals for enhanced user feedback.

9. Deployment & Hosting

-Configure environment variables for API keys and endpoints.

-Set up CI/CD using GitHub Actions.

-Deploy the application to Vercel, Netlify, or Firebase Hosting.

-Enable PWA support for offline usage.

10. Testing & Debugging

-Implement unit tests using Jest and Vue Testing Library.

-Write integration tests for API interactions.

-Use browser DevTools for performance monitoring.

-Conduct user testing to validate UX and functionality.
